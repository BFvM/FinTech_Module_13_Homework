Venture_funding_with_deep_learning

In this assignment we take on the role of a risk management associate at a venture capital firm, Alphabet Soup. We have been asked to create a model that predicts whether venture capital applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

A CSV has been provided containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Using machine learning and neural networks we will create a binary classifier model to predict whether an applicant will become a successful business. 

## In this challenge we:

* Prepared data for use on a neural network model.

* Compiled and evaluated a binary classification model using a neural network.

* Optimized the neural network model.
